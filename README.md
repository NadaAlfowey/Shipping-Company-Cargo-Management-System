# Shipping Company Cargo Management System

## Project Description
This C++ program is designed to automate the cargo-truck assignment process for a shipping company, optimizing the delivery of cargos in a way that maximizes efficiency and profitability. The system simulates the operation of cargo delivery and generates statistics to aid in process improvement. The program handles different types of cargos and trucks, applies specific loading and assignment rules, and simulates the entire process hour-by-hour.

## Features
- Automates cargo-truck assignment based on cargo type and truck availability.
- Simulates cargo delivery operations hour-by-hour.
- Provides statistical output to improve efficiency and profitability.
- Supports different operational modes: Interactive, Step-by-Step, and Silent.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make (optional for building)

## Usage

### Running the Simulation
To start the simulation, run the executable from the command line:
```bash
./shipping_simulation
```
Follow the prompts to select the operation mode:
1. **Interactive Mode**: Step through the simulation hour-by-hour with user interaction.
2. **Step-by-Step Mode**: Automatically progresses every second.
3. **Silent Mode**: Runs the simulation to completion without interaction, generating an output file.

### Input Files
Input files should be detailing trucks, cargos, and events.

### Output Files
Output files will contain detailed logs of cargo deliveries and system-generated statistics.
